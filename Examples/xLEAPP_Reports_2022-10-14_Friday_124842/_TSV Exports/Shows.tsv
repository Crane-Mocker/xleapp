Brush | Weekly Interviews w/ InfoSec Pros	Cyber Security Interviews	https://feeds.captivate.fm/cybersecurityinterviews/	There is “no one way” to start and stay in the field of cyber security. Whether you are involved from the military, law enforcement, consulting, or IT services, it doesn’t matter. I have had countless discussions for years with other professionals online, at conferences, or over drinks, which have changed the way I think about cyber security. That is where this podcast comes in. What if I can capture those moments and frank discussions? I want to share the stories from other cyber security leaders and influencers so everyone can learn from their respective journeys and challenges. Why did they take the path they did? Who were their mentors? How did they tackle some of their biggest career challenges? By hearing how the industry leaders and influencers got to where they are and how they overcame some of the problems they faced, I hope to shed light on the path for other professionals. I will discover what motivates them, explore their journey in cyber security, and discuss where they think the industry is going.	https://cybersecurityinterviews.com

In my years covering tech I became more fascinated by the stuff were were able to do on vast computing networks and ever speedier mobile and wireline broadband networks. Finally all of the elements of the technology I’ve covered in more than a decade have culminated in this moment and we’re creating the internet of things.<br />
<br />
No matter what you call it, we’re at a pivotal moment in the evolution of human creativity, business creation and productivity gains. We could see the gains we make in these next few years help us conserve resources and let us lead safer and healthier lives or we could open the door to a dystopian society where our every thought is monitored and our every utterance is effectively for sale. I hope to explore all of these issues, the people who will make it possible and the devices that will lead us there in the IoT Podcast. I hope you will join me."	https://iotpodcast.com
